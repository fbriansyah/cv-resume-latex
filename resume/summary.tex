\begin{cvparagraph}
Software Engineer passionate about building systems that scale. From \textbf{low-level programming} to \textbf{NLP research}, I've explored the full spectrum — now applying that breadth to \textbf{high-throughput payment systems} processing trillions in transaction volume. Driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and continuously learning new technologies.

% Old narrative summary (kept for reference)
% I have always been passionate in the field of \textbf{software engineering}. As I choose my major for college, I know that this field has so much to offer. I tried and explore a lot of things. From \textbf{low-level programming} until the field of \textbf{NLP and its Large Language Model}. I also have tried in many level of environment, from doing things by myself, group project, internship, part-time, and currently full-time. Mostly focused on \textbf{Backend Development} as of now, but still exploring various technology. As a big fan of \textbf{Vim}, I always trying to customize to find the most optimal environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools. Loved every process of it and I will continue this journey.
